MNIST dataset is train with around 8K parameers to get to the accuracy leavel of 99.4% . 
Number of epochs used is 15 and Simple data augmentation technique of random rotation and color filling with white is used. 
I have heavily used dpethwise channels to tune weigths and kept the number of output channels less to reduce the number of parameters.
